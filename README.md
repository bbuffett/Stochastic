# Stochastic
This repository contains files for stochastic models of the dipole moment. It includes additional notebooks for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the calculation of mean first passage times for a potential well model and a calculation of trends from two paleomagnetic models. A notebook is added for the calculation of the variance of a finite time average (PaleoMeans.ipynb)
